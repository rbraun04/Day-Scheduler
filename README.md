# Day-Scheduler

# Sunday - August 2
I started with pulling a bootstrap input field and altered the names to input for every hour from 8am-5pm with a save button and followed the format of the example.
I am struggling with the functionality and will need to research how to add a local 24 hour time to the program.  I started the javascript and added the click functionality and added user input to local storage.  I am struggling to understand how to change the color of the background for each time frame.

# Monday - August 3

I wanted to focus on creating a list of elements that you could delete at will but that presented a lot of problems.  I worked on first creating a div underneath the input field that would create a list of items each with a 'Finished!" button, giving the user more functionality should they want to edit tasks as complete.  This proved frustrating, the buttons were created and worked to delete the "div" contents but then when something was saved it would not return with to the screen with the bottom when the page was refreshed.  This would mean creating a different "finished!" button in the html and I don't think I have time to rebuild.

I also met with Bryan to discuss these problems, he gave me great help but ultimately this is proving to be tood difficult.

# Tuesday - August 4

Struggled today with the changes of backround functions that are dependent on the time.  I researched the functionality but for some reason the process is not working.  I will need to meet with Bryan again tomorrow to fix this issue.

# Wednseday - August 5 due tonight by midnight

Met with Bryan this morning, he helped me through the functions to change the background color of each hour.  I had forgotten to add the ID in the html to pull the time designation and that prevented the function from working.  

I also tried to work on layout but am running out of time to finish this before starting our group project tomorrow.
