# Day-Scheduler

Sunday - August 2
I started with pulling a bootstrap input field and altered the names to input for every hour from 8am-5pm with a save button and followed the format of the example.
I am struggling with the functionality and will need to research how to add a local 24 hour time to the program.  I started the javascript and added the click functionality and added user input to local storage.  I am struggling to understand how to change the color of the background for each time frame.
